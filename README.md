## Features

- **Insertion:** Add new student records to the system.
- **Deletion:** Remove student records from the system.
- **Search:** Search for a student record by roll number.
- **Rank List:** Maintain a rank list based on total marks using a heap data structure.
- **Display:** View all student records and the rank list.

## File Structure

- `main.cpp`: Contains the main program logic, including BST operations, heap operations, and user interaction.
- `structures.h`: Header file defining the structures used in the program, such as `student` and `node`.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Usage

1. Compile the program using a C++ compiler.
2. Run the compiled executable to start the Student Management System.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to perform operations such as insertion, deletion, search, and display.
